 news.2.d:0 "Anarchy in America! In a sudden series of events, the Federal Government of the United States of America has completely collapsed, as armed confrontations between various Vanguardist and National Populist groups overwhelmed their local formations. The remains of the Government and Military, and the rest of the American people who have not been driven to extremism have banded together in an uneasy alliance, denouncing the Vanguardist and Populist demagogues as traitors. As the various armies and militias of each side close in on one another, North America appears to be witnessing the largest and potentially most bloody conflict ever seen on the continent."

 news.9.t:0 "The Second Texas Revolution"
 news.9.d:0 "Dire news comes from Texas as it appears that swathes of rebel Texans have stormed the cities of Houston and Dallas, slaughtering Mexican troops and burning homes of the local Spanish-Speaking Tejano nobility. The rebels have since consolidated their territory, occupying land as far west as the Rocky Mountains and as far south as the Rio Grande, where they continue to fight Mexican counterattacks. Government officials and regional experts now express concern over whether this revolt could spark a whole new wave of nativist activity in Mexico, especially in the Centroamerica, Yucatan, California, Rio Grande, and Deseret regions of the overextended nation. As the death toll increases and the war continues, people in the region wonder…"

 news.10.t:0 "The Revolution"
 news.10.d:0 "Observing the political instability caused by the Texan revolt, many non-ethnic Mexicans under the Mexican yoke have decided to take up arms and fight against the tyrannical government. Vanguardist cells in Yucatan, Mormons in Deseret, nationalists in Central America, separatists in the Rio Grande region, and Californios have all risen up against Mexico and now approach the country’s heartland. California, Deseret, Rio Grande, and Texas have formed an uneasy pact of sorts to better fight their common Mexican enemy, while the Central Americans have agreed to set aside their differences until the external threat to their people is addressed. The Mexican government is in chaos as the army scrambles to address every front and quell revolt after revolt. With the recent turn of events, the very existence of the Mexican state hangs in the balance."

 news.11.t:0 "Smith Wins Presidential Election"
 news.11.d:0 "In a relative upset, Alfred Smith has secured the presidency over his opponent, Thomas Dewey. Having always supported more authoritarian and decisive action to deal with radical activity and the late economic depression, Smith was able to gain the support of most of the Southern, Northwestern and East Coast states. This victory over the more libertarian and democratic Dewey has angered libertarians, Vanguardists, and Populists alike, as Smith has recently championed policies of drastic action to deal with ‘un-American’ activity. Radicals who were preparing to spread their messages on the streets and march have retreated back to their homes in fear of being jailed for their beliefs. Although many expect an air of fear to rise over the more radical Rust Belt and Southern states, others see this as necessary to deter extremists and return the American economy to its former stability. This election has also seen radicals win seats in state senates, mayoral elections in Chicago and Birmingham, and notably a narrow Populist victory in the Alabama 8th District. However, Smith has recently expressed his dismay at such results and his hope to contest and maybe overturn these elections."

 news.12.t:0 "Dewey Wins Presidential Election"
 news.12.d:0 "After months of fierce competition in the United States’ presidential race, Thomas Dewey has beaten his opponent Alfred Smith. Having long championed a policy of more direct democracy and government projects to solve the economic and political crises in the nation, Dewey was able to gain the support of the Great Lakes area, the Northwest, and most importantly, New England. Although this recent victory over the more authoritarian Smith has left many hopeful, others feel that the current government is weak and apathetic to radical activity. In addition, various Populist and Vanguardist groups are expected to begin spreading their messages of revolution to a broader population in the Rust Belt and Southern states. Dewey’s administration really seems to have its work cut out for it as pacifying the radicals while also managing the economic and unemployment situation will be a heavy task to fulfill. However, Dewey appears hopeful and believes that his message of peace and recovery will convince the American populus to restore their confidence in the government. Also notable in the electoral results are some unprecedented radical victories. Two Populist-aligned representatives in Alabama and a Vanguardist sympathizer in the Chicago mayoral election have been elected to office, putting third party candidates in their highest positions of power since the Whigs in the nineteenth century."
 news.12.a:0 "An expectable result."
 news.13.t:0 "Mexico Surrenders!"
 news.13.d:0 "After the rebellions that plunged Mexico into a brutal war, the Mexican state entered into a period of instability and civil conflict. With the rebels defeating the demoralized Ejercito del Norte (Army of the North) the advance towards Mexico City was relatively unchecked, causing governmental collapse and surrender. With the Mexican state subjugated, rebel leaders are squabbling amongst themselves and vying for greater influence, most notably California and Texas. The future of Mexico remains relatively uncertain, but it seems (for now) that the nation will exist as a rump state plagued by internal instability and foreign authority."
 news.13.a:0 "An interesting development."
 news.14.t:0 "William Haywood Assassinated"
 news.14.d:0 "After many years of work advocating for trade and labor unions, prominent Vanguardist party member William ‘Big Bill’ Haywood has been assassinated last night. His death is being widely mourned by Rust Belt workers as he has long fought for equal pay and the right to organize. However, many Southerners celebrate the passing of this man as many take it to signify the decline of leftism in the United States. Contrary to their beliefs, the funeral procession, which will travel through the Rust Belt and end in New England, is expected to spread the message of Haywood and his fellow Vanguardists to a wider audience. Some violent actions by scattered Populists were also recently recorded, most notably in Lexington, Kentucky, where a group of farmers assaulted mourners, leading to clashes resulting in tens of injuries."

 news.15.t:0 "Official Vanguard Party of America Flag Made"
 news.15.d:0 "Today at the Fifteenth Annual Vanguardist Congress, many influential leftist politicians and artists gathered to discuss an official flag. Through much trial and tribulation, the delegates and artists were able to decide upon the ideal banner to represent their cause. The flag features the Vanguardist gear and wheat husk to symbolize seizing the means of production and achieving prosperity, the 13 stars symbolize 13 years ago when the Vanguard Party of America was born, and finally the 13 stripes to retain the American identity. Throughout the conference John ‘Jack’ Reed and especially Earl Browder were able to have their voices heard and gained some support. This recent conference is expected to unite more people under the Vanguardist cause and bring their message of communalism to a wider audience, further dividing the fractured American nation, and bringing many to the political extremes. This action has also frightened international observers, who begin to fear a Vanguardist revolt and class war."

 news.16.t:0 "Santa Fe Revolts!"
 news.16.d:0 "Having suffered discrimination by their Californian oppressors ever since the end of the Mexican rebellions, many influential figures and their followers in California’s easternmost territories have declared their independence as the Republic of Santa Fe. Although the local language is much the same as California’s, Santa Fe culture resembles a mixture of Mexican, Texan, and pioneer traditions. As a result of their recent exploitation by the Californian expansionists and large corporations, the people have grown quite hostile to Californian influence and developed a separate identity. The insurrectionists have already secured a formidable domain up to the Colorado River. Although they are not expected to attempt any offensive activity in the near future, their formidable militia force could pose a threat or even spell doom to any Californian effort to retake the region. However, California is inclined to pursue offensive action no matter the cost as Santa Fe could destroy their position as a regional power if allied with Texas. Given the recent demobilization of the Gran Exercito de California, many are skeptical about an early Californian victory. As of now, most predictions favor Santa Fe’s independence or a pyrrhic Californian win."
