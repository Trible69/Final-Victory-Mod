 mexlore.1.t:0 "We are Independent!"
 mexlore.1.d:0 "Over the past decades and centuries, our people have developed a unique cultural identity, entirely separate from that of Mexico. This has been a point of tension for a long time, but the spark that ignited our revolution came from exploitative Mexican resource extraction in the region, the profits of which were not given to the Californian populus. The people of California are sick and tired of the parasitic Mexican Government. As such, we have taken up arms and will fight to the death for our long-desired liberty and independence.\n\nNo sacrifice is too great for our nation. Any attack on our freedom and independence will be quashed by the far superior Exercito de California, which now moves southwards towards the Sonora Mountains, and later, Mexico City itself."
 mexlore.1.a:0 "Long live California! Death to the Mexican thieves and bandits!"
 mexlore.2.t:0 "We are Independent!"
 mexlore.2.d:0 "For the longest time, our great people were discriminated against by the ruling Tejano minority. The English-speaking Texans were given almost no representation within the governmental and economic spheres of the Mexican state. Furious at having been exploited and oppressed for so long, the Texan people took the opportunity to create a nation made for the English speaking population where the majority ruled.\n\nAlthough that first rebellion was crushed, the latest one has borne fruit. Our newest insurrection has encouraged other revolts, which now march hand-in-hand with ours towards Mexico City. The Mexican army is now on the retreat, reeling from defeat at the hands of their former subjects. We shall win the war, and prove the superiority of the Texan spirit once and for all!"
 mexlore.2.a:0 "Glory to our new nation! May Texas endure a thousand years!"
 mexlore.3.t:0 "We are Independent!" 
 mexlore.3.d:0 "Throughout the 19th century, our Mormon people fled to Utah to escape religious persecution. Throughout that time, we developed a highly conservative culture and unique national identity based upon our spiritual connection to the land. All was good until the evil Mexican colonizers oppressed us for our religious views and disrespected our conservative beliefs, forcing Catholic conversion and exiling our leaders. However, the sinners’ rule wouldn’t last, as the latest Texan revolt and political instability provided the perfect opportunity for us to create our own nation, built upon conservative ideals and Mormon theology.\n\nNow we must fight for our new state and survival. If we win today, our religion and state will be secured for many years to come. However, losing would mean a return to oppression and shame under the unholy Mexican regime. The fate of our people hangs in the balance of this war."
 mexlore.3.a:0 "The Mormon faith shall not be extinguished!"
 mexlore.4.t:0 "We are Independent!"
 mexlore.4.d:0 "For years, the Rio Grande region has been neglected and its wealth sapped by the Mexican government for use elsewhere. However, their injustices wouldn’t last long as our great people have finally risen up in revolt, declaring the new Republico del Rio Grande. Although our independence is still a matter of controversy, especially among the local Mexican nationalists and elite, the working class is united in its struggle against the Mexican monster.\n\nAlthough our army is rather insignificant, it still marches together with the Texans and Californians towards Mexico City. Victory would mean an end to Mexican oppression, but defeat would mean a return to shame and neglect. We must fight to the last man as our fate hangs in the balance of this war."
 mexlore.4.a:0 "Viva la Revolucion!"
 mexlore.5.t:0 "We are Independent!"
 mexlore.5.d:0 "It was always seen as unlikely that us Central Americans could be a unified political force. But somehow, the peoples of Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Honduras have come together to fight for our independence from the Mexican oppressors. Although the political situation is heated at best, a few military advisors are confident that united, we can efficiently strike the Mexican heartland. For now, however, generals squabble in San Salvador over how such an attack should be conducted. The political situation is no better as Hondurans, Nicaraguans, and Costa Ricans demand greater autonomy, while Salvadorans and Guatemalans advocate for the creation of a strong central government. Dissatisfied Costa Rican politicians have even been seen driving back home from Parliament, irate over the current situation.\n\nAlthough disunited, our rebellion still has a role to play in attacking Mexico’s southern flank. It is our task to bring as much of the Exercito de Mexico as possible southwards to allow Texas and California an easier advance to the Mexican heartland. Even given the importance of this task, our politicians and generals have thus far failed to complete it due to their inability to end the political deadlock.\n\nWe must solve the current domestic problems quickly, as should they continue to drive our people apart, Mexico may take advantage of this situation and end our nascent Republic. Will we stand united, or fall divided?"
 mexlore.5.a:0 "May we stand united."
 mexlore.6.t:0 "We are Independent!" 
 mexlore.6.d:0 "For centuries, the indigenous Maya majority in Yucatan has been abused, battered, and oppressed by our Spanish and later Mexican colonizers. We have sustained conflict after conflict, genocide after genocide, but yet, our spirit lives on. Mexican oppression in our land ended this week as a Vanguardist coalition of Mayans and working-class Mexicans captured the peninsula, slaughtering all who opposed. A new dictatorship of the proletariat was declared as Maya and Mexican workers marched hand-in-hand for the first time in our history. Our flag now waves proudly over every Yucatec building and square, watching over our brave soldiers as they begin their march towards Mexico City. Although relatively insignificant, our rebellion still has a role to play in attacking Mexico’s southern flank. It is our task to bring as much of the Exercito de Mexico as possible southwards to allow Texas and California an easier advance to the Mexican heartland. Military advisors are confident in victory, since our latest probing attacks into Mexican territory have met little resistance thus far. As our troops finally begin their full-scale march, there can be little doubt that the Mexican monster shall be extinguished once and for all."
