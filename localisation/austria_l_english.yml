 aus_the_heimwehr:0 "The Heimwehr"
 aus_the_heimwehr_desc:0 "Born from the carcass of the Austrian Army, the Heimwehr is a vast array of disgruntled soldiers, thugs, and gangsters used by the Imperial Council to fight back against the Vanguardist Uprisings and Civil War in the Twenties. Though they did save the Austrian Nation as we know it, the collection of Ultra-Reactionaries has become the De Facto armed forces of Austria and has begun to strangle local politics with the massive influence they have garnered from the chaos of recent years."
 aus_the_salzburg_front:0 "The Salzburg Front"
 aus_the_salzburg_front_desc:0 "The Salzburg is, on paper at least, a broad coalition of parties on the Right and Far-Right Political Spectrum. Yet in practice, They are little more than puppets of the Heimwehr who have either been bribed or threatened into submission to rubber stamp any legislation that best befits the leadership of the Austrian Home Guard."
 aus_the_kanzler_and_his_merry_men:0 "The Kanzler and his Merry Men"
 aus_the_kanzler_and_his_merry_men_desc:0 "Engelbert Dolfuss, Chancellor of Austria, once held an Iron Grip over the Heimwehr and the Reactionary Parties of Austria. Yet the Austrian Civil War damaged his prestige, and slowly but surely, the Salzburg Front he had spent a lifetime building began to tear apart. Experts have identified three established, but unspoken camps within the Austrian Right: The Reactionaries, led by Dolfuss hope to sustain the Austrofascist system constructed by Dolfuss in order to defend Austria from the Red Menace. The Miltarists are led by Dolfuss’ former friend, Prince Ernst Rudiger Starhermberg, a vengeful officer from the Heimwehr, believes the only way to restore Austria’s former glory is to forcefully reconquer the former lands of the Empire, even suggesting eventual war with France to avenge the greatest humiliation inflicted upon the Austrian Nation. The third and final camp are the Ultranationalists, led by the ambitious Arthur Seyss-Inquart. Seyss-Inquart’s ultranationalists are an extreme group- they believe in radical racial and conspiracy theories about the downfall of the Empire and seek to unleash a hellish reckoning upon Central and Eastern Europe through brutal conflicts. The 1930s have seen the continued slipping of Dolfuss’ grasp on power, and the continued divide between himself and his gradually fracturing faction."
 aus_vernichtungsprinzip:0 "Vernichtungsprinzip"
 aus_vernichtungsprinzip_desc:0 "The Annihilation Principle was first coined by Starhermberg in 1931, as a last resort to permanently quell leftover Vanguardist elements from the Civil War. The unofficial policy among the leading figures of Austria has been simple: Anyone who is seen as a potential threat must be terminated. Starhermberg’s proposal worked with bloody effects, with roving bands of Heimwehr torching the Czech and Austrian countryside in search of “Dissidents.”\n\nThe Definition of “Potential Threat” however has been distorted beyond belief. Various leaders of the Heimwehr and Austrian Reactionaries have greatly expanded the Annihilation Principle to satisfy petty grudges, and to keep their comfortable hold on power. While this may benefit the Austrian Elite in the short term, the people will continuously grow resentful.\n\nAnd they will eventually snap."
 aus_the_red_kaiserin:0 "The Red Kaiserin"
 aus_the_red_kaiserin_desc:0 "Her Imperial Majesty Elisabeth Marie Henriette Stephanie Gisela von Habsburg, by the Grace of God Empress of Austria is an unwieldy figure to the Reactionaries of Austria. Infuriated at the toppling of her father’s plans for a sustainable, egalitarian multi-ethnic Empire, she has rallied the remaining Socialists within the depths of Austria and has the few Monarchist generals at her back- proving to be a massive thorn in the efforts of Dolfuss and his band. Though admired throughout the world as a champion of reform in a place so swollen with Reaction and Irredentism, many believe that the Empress is no match for the Salzburg Front and the Powerful, albeit bloated Heimwehr. Yet if the internal divisions of the Heimwehr could be exploited, a Habsburg Restoration may yet come about."
