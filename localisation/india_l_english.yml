 agricultural_economy_desc:0 "Introduction of Industrialization in the colony at first seemed successful. Factories were popping up left and right but constant famines and food shortages have left most of the populace to work in farms. European techniques have failed increasingly in improving production and agriculture. This has led the colonial administration to direct most production and populace for maintaining the colony, which has led to lower manpower and production for military matters."
