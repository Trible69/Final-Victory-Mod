 california.1.t:0 "Mexico has Surrendered!"
 california.1.d:0 "After many months of battle, we have driven the Mexican armies to Ciudad del Mexico (Mexico City) and forced their general surrender. Victory celebrations are already being organized in Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Francisco where citizens will be given triple rations and beautiful shows of fireworks and performances. Although this battle is won, a new enemy arises. Texas hopes to increase its influence in the area and challenge our hegemony over the West Coast. We will need to address this threat by clever diplomatic maneuvering and even possibly military conflict. Through such action, it will be possible to preserve and strengthen our new state."
 california.1.a:0 "Excelsior! To the future ahead!"
 california.2.t:0 "Our Eastern Territories Revolt!"
 california.2.d:0 "Frantic news from Santa Fe just arrived. Clyde Tingley’s Army and other militias have risen up in rebellion against our righteous liberation and occupation of their lands. A state of emergency has been declared in every county east of the Colorado River as the militiamen have consolidated that swath of our territory. Advisors presume that these pesky rebels started their insurrection in protest of our economic usage of the area and strategic emplacement in the area against our foe Texas. Regardless of the reason, these idiotic “separatists” must be dealt with by force. Our recently demobilized army must be remobilized, even though it may lower popular morale. These rebels should really be dealt with soon if we hope to contend with Texas and defeat them. Failure to bring Tingley’s revolters to their knees may end our position of influence in North America."
 california.2.a:0 "To Arms!"
