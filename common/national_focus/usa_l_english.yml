Why should external conflict be the end of this peace? Thomas Paine did not write Common Sense as a way to rally our people against the Prussians, so why should we dictate our Italian brothers to fight their own families?

 USA.1.t:0 "Situation of America in 1936"
 USA.1.d:0 "The latest American century has been wrought with uneasy compromise, failed dreams of westward expansion, and more recently, radicalism. Ever since our independence was secured, the American Dream brought many pioneers westward towards the Mississippi, providing ample opportunity to gain new territory. Soon we gained French Louisiana through the inexpensive Louisiana Purchase, gaining a new national breadbasket and resource center. Although the first stage of westward expansion met only the resistance of the local Indians, a new obstacle to our American domination loomed on the horizon. The newly independent Mexico, although somewhat accepting of our pioneer immigrants, were unwilling to bend the knee to our superior will and righteous hegemony over the continent."
 USA.1.a:0 "Continue to Page 2"
 USA.2.t:0 "The 1936 Elction"
 USA.2.d:0 "Even though in recent years the rise of Vanguardism and National Populism has seen radical politicians propelled into the upper ranks of the government, fortunately no presidential candidates are firebreathing populists or bloodthirsty Vanguardists, and instead the two candidates are relative moderates Alfred Smith and Thomas Dewey. Smith is a slightly more of a reactionary than Dewey, and believes that authoritarian elements are needed in the threatened democracy to keep America from falling into the hands of Vanguardists and Populists. Dewey, on the other hand, firmly believes that it is a mistake to direct America to anything else but proper democracy, and vows to keep the country together under a moderate democratic presidency. The votes have been counted, and the results are ready to be broadcast on the radio. The winner of the election is..."
 USA.2.a:0 "Alfred Smith, we need better!"
 USA.2.b:0 "Dewey, our democracy lives on!"
 USA.6.t:0 "Isolationist no more"
 USA.6.d:0 "Brothers, the dawn of  our destinies has arrived! Ever since the founding of the United States, many of our neighbors, foreign and abroad, have shown great strides in knocking our great nation down. Well not anymore! Out of the ashes of the great American divide, our flag of freedom shall stand to meet any feat of power and knowledge on the world stage, because that is what is what the American Dream entails! So men of New York, men of Georgia, Louisiana, and Illinois, join the cause to fight against tyranny, or else they will be the cause at which humanity will fall to its knees!"
 USA.6.a:0 "This will help America!"
 USA.7.t:0 "Protests in Chicago!"
 USA.7.d:0 "Vanguardism in Chicago has grown to the point that people have occupied the local stock market, leading to a complete halt in daily trades. As a result, Vanguardist extremists have been emboldened and their ideas more widespread."
 USA.7.a:0 "We have more important matters."
 USA.8.t:0 "Protests in Atlanta!"
 USA.8.d:0 "National Populism in Atlanta has gained popularity to the point that airport and transportation workers have refused to go to work, instead holding up signs in protest of the current administration. This has caused increased popularity of the National Populist ideology and creed in Georgia."
 USA.8.a:0 "It's not a big deal."
 USA.9.t:0 "Protests in Detroit!"
 USA.9.d:0 "The rise of Vanguardism in Detroit has grown to the point that automobile workers have gone on strike in protest of the status-quo, leading to a popularity boost in their Vanguardist ideology among local workers."
 USA.9.a:0 "We have more important matters."
 USA.10.t:0 "Protests in Richmond!"
 USA.10.d:0 "The increase of National Populist ideas in Richmond has occurred to the point that local unemployed people have gathered around the Virginia State Capitol, causing further growth of National Populism locally."
 USA.10.a:0 "It's not that big of a deal"
 USA.11.t:0 "Protests in Ohio!"
 USA.11.d:0 "Vanguardism in Ohio has grown to the point in where citizens in Cleveland and Akron have blocked highways to police, disrupting law enforcement activity and allowing Vanguardist leaders to preach their ideology freely in cities and towns."
 USA.11.a:0 "We need to send the police in soon."
 USA.12.t:0 "Protests in Miami"
 USA.12.d:0 "Miami construction workers, seeing a pay decrease, have occupied the newly funded local beaches in protest of the government diverting funds from their work to be used on local parks. This daring protest is causing an increase of extremist National Populism in the area."
 USA.12.a:0 "Send in the police."
 USA.13.t:0 "Protests in North Dakota!"
 USA.13.d:0 "Vanguardist oil workers in North Dakota have left their workspaces to protest in front of the State Capitol in Bismarck for better wages. This protest is sure to boost their ideology in the region."
 USA.13.a:0 "The police should be able to handle it."
 USA.14.t:0 "Charles Lindbergh holds public speech in Missouri"
 USA.14.d:0 "This afternoon, prominent National Populist Charles Lindbergh held a speech outside Kansas City, Missouri to a rousing crowd of 30,000. His speech has brought National Populist ideology to the mainsteam, signalling an increase in the ideology's popularity even among average citizens."
 USA.14.a:0 "He is a traitor!"
 USA.15.t:0 "William Haywood calls for revolution in Chicago"
 USA.15.d:0 "William Haywood and his loyal supporters have gathered in a Chicago square. Haywood spoke angrily about the government and economy, bringing his ideals to the minds of many Rust Belt workers."
 USA.15.a:0 "Bring these traitors down!"
 USA.16.t:0 "Charles Lindbergh Orders Riots in Missouri!"
 USA.16.d:0 "Charles Lindbergh and his supporters have gathered in many Missouri cities, ready to set fire to government buildings and the houses of government sympathizers. This has terrorized many government supporters and rapidly brought the National Populist ideology to the hearts and minds of Missourians."
 USA.16.a:0 "Send in the National Guard!"
 USA.17.t:0 "William Haywood Orders Riots in Chicago!"
 USA.17.d:0 "William Haywood and his followers have burned local government buildings and forced the cops to evacuate the 3rd Precinct of the city. Vanguardism has grown to the point that local Vanguardists seem to be taking control of the city and Chicago countryside."
 USA.17.a:0 "Send in the military!"
 USA.18.t:0 "Question of Cuba"
 USA.18.d:0 "We bought Cuba from the Spanish many years ago, ignoring the natives' desire for increased power. This has begged the question-should we make Cuba our newest state? Integrating Cuba as a state could cause revolts as the Cubans have no desire to be integrated into our nation."
 USA.18.a:0 "Make Cuba a state."
 USA.18.b:0 "Give Cuba Autonomy."
 USA.18.c:0 "Keep Cuba a territory."
 USA.19.t:0 "Cuba Revolts!"

 USA.19.a:0 "Damn it!"
 USA.20.t:0 "Cuba declares independence!"
 USA.20.d:0 "With our military having suppressed many Cubans' wishes for self-determination, the Cuban people have begun to arm themselves. Now that america is distracted by their Civil War Cuba saw their opportunity to finally gain their much-wanted independence.."
 USA.20.a:0 "We need to worry about the rebels first!"
 USA.21.t:0 "The end of the Civil War"
 USA.21.d:0 "The bloody conflict has finally ended. Now is the time for forgiveness and healing, and to prevent another Civil War from ever happening again"
 USA.21.a:0 "Recovery is important"
 USA.22.t:0 "Haywood Wins the Illinois 7th District"
 USA.22.d:0 "After the incumbent Representative Schuetz died recently from a stroke, the 7th Congressional District was left to an emergency election. Through a relative blowout victory the admired William “Big Bill” Haywood, a longtime favorite of auto workers and unionists, was able to secure the position. Although Haywood is rather old and expected to die in the next few months by his doctors, such a result has given the Vanguardist Party of America their first major victory ever. This comes as another victory for radicalism, which has begun to cause fear among moderates in the region. Already Haywood and others have started major strikes of auto workers and electricians demanding better working conditions, less hours, and greater pay. Advisors worry that the strikers and some of the unemployed population might create a situation of political instability and violence in the near future."
 USA.22.a:0 "A worrying development."
 USA.23.t:0 "Lindbergh’s Rising Power"
 USA.23.d:0 "After having rather narrowly secured the Alabama 8th District in a fierce race, Charles Lindbergh immediately began to make efforts to increase Populist influence in the House of Representatives, gaining the support of many rising “Dixiecrats.” Already a few other Deep South representatives have been brought into Lindbergh’s clique and a certain handful of them have even considered joining the Populist Party. Lindbergh’s rising influence has brought Populism to the mainstream. Organized protests which have often been violent lately are increasing in number and intensity at an exponential rate. Experts fear that if left unchecked, this nativist and racist movement could possibly set the stage for political turmoil or even civil war."
 USA.23.a:0 "He must be stopped!"
 USA.24.t:0 "Situation of Amersica in 1936 2"
 USA.24.d:0 "Furthermore, the failure of the Texan Revolution rendered any intervention in the region unjustifiable, and soon the expansionist President Polk was replaced by the more nativist Lewis Cass. The next decades (often described as the ‘Period of Discontent’) were spent hotly debating the institution of slavery and its continuity. Eventually, most instances of slavery were outlawed, largely due to the fact that Eli Whitney was unable to patent his cotton gin and bring it to the Southern market. Although Black Southerners were made free in name, they continue to be subject to the draconian Jim Crow Laws, which reduce Black rights and effectively barred them from voting. The atmosphere of racism and xenophobia present in many Southern states helped bring about the National Populist ideology as it exists in the South today. Such Populist fervor has quite troublingly carried on, spreading its roots in the South and helping create the political landscape there as it exists today. Our past years have seen a terrible Great Depression wreak havoc on our economy and spirit. Government and financial mismanagement exacerbated the problem, helping bring about the worst financial crisis we have ever seen. Although Franklin Delano Roosevelt has been able to execute some form of damage control, the situation has lately been almost impossible to address. As a result, FDR is expected not to be actively seeking re-election, leaving presidential hopefuls Thomas Dewey and Alfred Smith at the forefront of the race. Hopefully we learn from our mistakes towards the future. Our Present Advisors and analysts alike have been quick to point out the worrying rise of radicalism in our nation. Although Populists had in past times been unable to win but the least important elections, the failing economy and political instability of today bring many Southerners to the Populist cause. Furthermore, Vanguardism has spread its evil roots to the Rust Belt through false promises, overconfident politicians, and the exploitation of the ailing economy for political gain. What used to be a fringe party occupied by overenthusiastic students and Soviet sympathizers has recently gained a large grassroots following from the poorest poor and a large swath of the American youth. Many fear the rise of radicalism and the destruction or mutilation of our American identity. Surely it would require a skillful and intelligent leader to masterfully navigate us through the coming conflict and political mess to bring about a new era of stability and create a better American future."
 USA.24.a:0 "A nation in shambles… "
 USA.25.t:0 "Preparing for Civil War"
 USA.25.d:0 "“As you well know, Mr. President, civil unrest plagues our nation. Ever since the latest election, radical activity has greatly increased, leading our own government to consider more… covert options of keeping the states in line. Should a civil war begin, it would be most important to secure the industrially and militarily vital East Coast, as well as the Appalachian and Great Lakes areas. Although our resources are rather low, we estimate that the military can recruit militia or even pursue direct intervention in some of these states, albeit at the cost of precious time and assets.” \n\n“I see. So how long do we have until the real conflict begins?” \n\n“Well, we estimate five months, as the radical militias have grown ever bolder, posing a strain to our local governments in the South and Rust Belt. We should act quickly, or else other areas will surely suffer the same fate.” \n\n"
 USA.25.a:0 "Very well. Have the Army and National Guard on standby. Prepare to divert equipment and troops wherever necessary."

 USA.26.t:0 "Election of 1940"
 USA.26.d:0 "As the country recovers from the civil war, an election is being held to continue a small note of normalcy for Americans. Alfred’s leadership during the war brought him many praises for taking charge, but was also derided as being almost dictatorial with his powers. In an effort to oppose Alfred, the opposing party put Gardner, a relatively popular politician calling for reforms amongst the party system to never let radicalism grow to such an extent. Whatever, the results maybe, we may see a very different America by the end of these candidates’ terms."

 USA.27.t:0 "Election of 1940"
 USA.27.d:0 "Election season has returned to the war-torn nation. This year’s race has seen incumbent Thomas Dewey go against the confident and likable military man MacArthur. Although Dewey is popular in the recently repatriated Rust Belt and South, MacArthur has the North’s undying confidence for the victories he helped achieve in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania. Whatever the result, most experts agree that this vote will be a close one."
 USA.27.a:0 "Dewey, he is the only chance for Democracy to live on!"
 USA.27.b:0 "Douglas MacArthur, The War Hero!"
 USA.28.t:0 "Election of 1944"
 USA.28.d:0 "MacArthur’s presidency, while being heavily criticized, was one of utmost stability as the leader pushed resistance efforts to the ground with no chance of harming the people once again. However, Archie argues that MacArthur is turning America into a military machine to fight in imperialist wars. Archie calls for the government to focus on the ruined regions of America to push forward towards a progressive and safe society for all."

 USA.30.t:0 "Election of 1944"
 USA.30.d:0 "As a new era in American politics begins, two new candidates are in the running to bring America into the world’s eyes. Rockefeller, a huge industrialist, promises to bring America economic superiority with its abundance of natural resources and relative peace among its lands. Archie, son of Theodore Roosevelt, calls for reforms for the American people who have felt disconnected from the government that's supposed to help them. He wants to make American people the focus of the government, or as he says in one of his campaigns speeches “the government should be for the people, by the people, and with the people.” The elections will be close as people look to the government or the economy for help."

Numerous workers, go on strike and demand better conditions. The Vanguardist Party of America recently exploded in popularity when the Great Depression worsened, this caused workers to go on strike to protest against the Federal Government.\n\nThe Current situation has transformed America into a hotbed for violence and bloodshed, it can all come crashing down soon."

With that they also say that there is a chance that America will be destroyed if it gets into a war that it cannot handle. They also say that the effects of foreign influence can be a danger to America, final thing is there is a political situation that cannot benifit America on the world stage. \n\nOne issue that both sides are using to their advantage is the increasing radicalization of the American people. Anti-Isolationists say that if we can get foreign ministers and support we may be able to calm the people, and be able to avoid any rebellions. Pro-Isolationists say that we must remain isolated so we can focus on the populace, "We cannot improve America, if we are bothered with the issues of people overseas". \n\nThe issue has now come to congress, and the vote will decide the future of America."

Such infringement upon our territorial and national integrity will surely not go unmatched, as we plan to destroy the pathetic Indian nation once the current civil war is won.\nFor now, however, reports issuing from the occupied states depict small-scale violence and atrocities upon the American settlers in an attempt to restore Indian dominance over the conquered lands. Escaping caravans of Whites have been seen crossing the border into Canadian territory, soon to be replaced by the conquering savages.
