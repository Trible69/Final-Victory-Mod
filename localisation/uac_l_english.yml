 UAC.1.d:0 "The deadly American conflict has finally ended, with thousands falling victim to the murderous flames of war. Now is the time to reunite our nation, and to prevent such a brutal conflict from ever occurring again."
 UAC.1.a:0 "Recovery is important."
 UAC.2.t:0 "William Haywood Assassinated!"
 UAC.2.d:0 "William Haywood, our beloved leader, was killed today. Police say when William Haywood was walking to his Chicago Hotel, a car drove past the Chairman. From witnesses, the car was black with all tinted windows, and out came a M1911 from that car. His bodyguards tried to save him but it was too late. The Chairman was dead and the suspects fled from the scene. Police have suspected it to be Populist supporters, but others disagree and say it was a member in Al Capone’s Five Points Gang. Al Capone has come out and denied these accusations and says that he financially supported Haywood and his campaign. It is not known who exactly did it but it is known that the Police are looking hard for the suspect."
 UAC.2.a:0 "We will find who did it!"
 UAC.3.t:0 "Re-establish Elections?"
 UAC.3.d:0 "Now that national order is restored, the Council of the Communes has recently been at odds over the issue of elections. Emil Seidel and the more libertarian Vanguardists favor that we resume Federalist-style elections for Vanguardist Party Premier, although Norman Thomas’ clique and many Bolshevik sympathizers wish that Thomas stay in power for life.\n\nBoth sides have recently given their case and the vote is being counted. The results are close but…"
 UAC.3.a:0 "Seidel’s faction narrowly wins the day! Elections are to be planned shortly."
 UAC.3.b:0 "Norman Thomas wins out and becomes leader-for-life!"
 UAC.4.t:0 "1939 Electon, Norman Thomas VS Emil Seidel"
 UAC.4.d:0 "Election Day is here! Although recently condemned by a few extremists and Bolsheviks, Emil Seidel has lately been successful in securing the hearts and minds of a large grassroots movement that aims to bring about reform and create peace and liberty in the nation. However, Norman Thomas and his supporters still retain a plurality in the Council of the Communes and exceeding support amongst city goers and minorities. The Chairman Debates, ending with no clear victor, have divided the people and rendered this election a toss-up. Tensions run high tonight as people cling to their radios, hoping for the desired result."
 UAC.4.a:0 "Norman Thomas. His popularity and success has granted him the victory."
 UAC.4.b:0 "Emil Seidel. His growth and promise sealed the vote."
 UAC.5.t:0 "1942 Elections, Norman Thomas VS Jack Reed"
 UAC.5.d:0 "Election Day has arrived once again. The incumbent Norman Thomas faces the well-liked and energetic John “Jack” Reed in an election that could very well turn either way. Reed is widely supported by America’s youth, as well as many Southerners and New Englanders who believe that his election will shift the political spectrum to the right and bring about reform. However, Thomas has the confidence of minorities, manual workers, and traditional Marxist-Bolsheviks. \n\nThis year’s voting has also been quite controversial as Thomas has sent groups of plainclothes policemen to harass voters in key Reedist areas, generating violence and criticism. Such activity has recently drawn the interest of former Federalist and Populist war photographers, who can be seen perched on rooftops and terraces capturing the action. This has led Reed to speak out in a fiery speech, where he denounced the “power-hungry Thomas and his campaign of suppression.”\n\nTo the criticism of many, the election is still allowed to continue despite Thomas’ tactics of voter suppression. The votes have been hurriedly counted and displayed to the public. The winner is..."
 UAC.5.a:0 "Thomas! Although his legitimacy comes into question, he has secured the vote."
 UAC.5.b:0 "Reed! The power of the American voter base has surpassed Thomas’ meddling."
 UAC.6.t:0 "1942 Elections, Emil Seidel VS Jack Reed"
 UAC.6.d:0 "Election Day has arrived once again! The incumbent Emil Seidel, popular as ever, faces off against the striking Jack Reed. Although Reed is popular especially amongst Southern and New England reformists, Seidel retains a large degree of popularity amongst a new coalition of libertarian socialists and hardliners. The split nature of this election has brought about a great deal of popular division, resulting in mass peaceful gatherings across the nation. People sit attached to television sets and radios in public viewing places, awaiting the results of the vote. Soon the ABC advertisements ended, following with the statement:"
 UAC.6.a:0 "Seidel has won this year’s election!"
 UAC.6.b:0 "Reed claims victory in this year’s Election for Chairman!"
 UAC.7.t:0 "1945 Elections, Norman Thomas VS Earl Browder"
 UAC.7.d:0 "Election Season has arrived once again, bringing about a renewed wave of patriotism across the nation. Although Thomas has lost some of his popularity and legitimacy, he maintains most of the electorate and can use the loyal National Guard to quell dissent. Even with the current election odds, the rising Earl Browder seeks to contest Thomas through gaining the confidence of a “silent majority.” His voters seem to be confident in victory too, although their gatherings are often met with detachments of police.\n\nThis year’s vote has brought about an increased amount of voter participation, as Thomas’ re-election could mean a new dictatorship in all but name. Such a possibility has generated a 90% turnout in this year’s election.\n\nTonight’s results are broadcast on ABC. The winner is declared to be:"
 UAC.7.a:0 "Thomas! His crackdown on opposition and tampering with the vote earns him a relatively illegitimate victory."
 UAC.7.b:0 "Browder! No amount of meddling could silence the people!"
 UAC.8.t:0 "1945 Elections, Emil Seidel VS Earl Browder"
 UAC.8.d:0 "Election Season has arrived once again! Two-time incumbent Seidel, the current face of modern Leftism, runs against the promising Earl Browder, who advocates for a return to the original Vanguardist policies of Norman Thomas’s time. Although both candidates are quite close, Seidel has a slight advantage amongst minorities, children, and reformists.\n\nSo far the day has been peaceful, unlike some of the previous elections. Instead of fighting Browderists, Seidelists have simply gone to their respective bars and homes to watch the election unfold on television. America’s eyes lay on the TV set, eagerly anticipating the results. Soon the ABC logo flashes, followed with the statement…"
 UAC.8.a:0 "Seidel has won the day once again!"
 UAC.8.b:0 "Browder has achieved a surprise victory, making him our nation’s new Chairman!"
 UAC.9.t:0 "1945 Elections, Jack Reed VS Earl Browder"
 UAC.9.d:0 "Election Season has arrived once again! The incumbent Jack Reed, master of reform and compromise, goes against the rising Earl Browder. Reed has maintained his popularity in the South and New England and even expanded his base of support to many minority groups. However, Browder has won over the favor of many students, socialists, and even some hardliner Vanguardists.\n\nAlthough the two groups have always maintained peaceful and even cordial relations, the coming election and poll gatherings saw some limited violence, most notably when a crowd of jokesters tried and failed to pour bags of flour on Reed’s head. However, this marks a change from the voter suppression of the 1942 election and the anti-socialist rhetoric of the Federalist era, which were often marked by riots and injuries.\n\nAt 11:30 PM the official results are announced live on ABC. We are glad to inform our viewers that..."
 UAC.9.a:0 "Reed will remain our Chairman!"
 UAC.9.b:0 "Browder is set to be our new Chairman!"
 UAC.10.t:0 "“August Days” Riots"
 UAC.10.d:0 "Terrible news from our major cities! As a result of the clearly botched and rigged election, many citizens took to the streets in peaceful protest. However, this peace wouldn’t last as Norman Thomas ordered a swift dispersal of any “deplorables,” resulting in chaos as police battalions struggled to fight the ever-growing wave of protesters. In New York much of the Manhattan Division was overrun yesterday, as protesters demanded that Thomas step down and give his seat to the rightful Earl Browder. The failure of the government to meet any of the rioters’ demands further worsened the situation, causing some to gather near Thomas’ residence.\n\nAlthough the National Guard has been mobilized and since dispersed many of the dissidents, this gathering marks one of the largest in the country’s history, causing great concern for the Chairman and his cabinet. If nothing else, the recent protest shows the illegitimacy of Thomas’ rule and the resistance of the American people to his ideals."
 UAC.10.a:0 "Norman Thomas’ unpopularity has been placed on display for all to see."
