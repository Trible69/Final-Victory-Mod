 UAC.2.t:0 "William Haywood Assassinated!"
 UAC.2.d:0 "William Haywood, our beloved leader, was killed today. Police say when William Haywood was walking to his Chicago Hotel, a car drove past the Chairman. From witnesses, the car was black with all tinted windows, and out came a M1911 from that car. His bodyguards tried to save him but it was too late. The Chairman was dead and the suspects fled from the scene. Police have suspected it to be Populist supporters, but others disagree and say it was a member in Al Capone’s Five Points Gang. Al Capone has come out and denied these accusations and says that he financially supported Haywood and his campaign. It is not known who exactly did it but it is known that the Police are looking hard for the suspect."
