 broken_nation:0 "Broken Nation"
 broken_nation_desc:0 "The country has fallen apart, with vanguardism and national-populism on the rise. Additionally, the country is plagued by economic mismanagement on the part of the federal government, which is led by the Founder's Vision Party."
 minor_depression:0 "Minor Depression"
 minor_depression_desc:0 "Since America has been isolated for nearly 200 years, it's trading has only been kept at a minimum, with that when the Great Depresion, which was started by France, started America was mostly unaffected by it, but there were still some effects from it."
 isolationist:0 "200 years Isolationist"
 isolationist_desc:0 "Back in 1776, our founding fathers declared independence for a nation birthed in freedom, peace, and justice. Since then, many have flocked from all corners of the world to escape violence and persecution and we have made a perfect safe haven that is blocked off from the outside world. Why should external conflict be the end of this peace? Thomas Paine did not write Common Sense as a way to rally our people against the Prussians, so why should we dictate our Italian brothers to fight their own families? Even if there is conflict outside our borders, we shouldn't tire ourselves with that sort of nonsense."
 recover_civil_war:0 "Recovery from the Civil War"
 recover_civil_war_desc:0 "As the bombs stopped dropping, as the guns stopped firing, and as the screams began to echo away, one party reigned victorious. After years of war, Americans can say grace as one people again. Now it's our duty to pick up the rubble and rebuild the nation back to its former glory. Soon, our leaders will manage to plot a new course for these United States. Will it take us to the gates of heaven or the depths of hell, only time will tell. We may never salute the Stars and Stripes the same way again."

 n100_year_debt_1:0 "100 year debt"
 n100_year_debt_1_desc:0 "Our already bankrupt treasury had to resort to borrowing French money to address the cost of the past war. The great price in war equipment and fortifications has created an immense amount of debt to the French state which needs to be repaid as soon as possible. The presence of such debt will make economic recovery long-winded and difficult, possibly causing economic depression for decades to come. If this pattern of economic failure continues, our position as a regional economic power will hang in the balance."
 n100_year_debt_2:0 "Paying Off The Debt"
 n100_year_debt_2_desc:0 "The finance minister and the Banco Central de Mexico have both agreed that the best course of action to deal with the financial crisis is to begin repaying our debt to France. Although this will require us to print money en masse, the loss of our currency’s value will be made good by our eventual economic recovery and debt repayment. After all, when has printing money ever gone wrong?"

 agricultural_economy:0 "Agricultural Economy"
 agricultural_economy_desc:0 "Introduction of Industrialization in the colony at first seemed successful. Factories were popping up left and right but constant famines and food shortages have left most of the populace to work in farms. European techniques have failed increasingly in improving production and agriculture. This has led the colonial administration to direct most production and populace for maintaining the colony, which has led to lower manpower and production for military matters."
