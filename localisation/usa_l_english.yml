Additionally, the country is plagued by economic mismanagement on the part of the federal government, led by the Founders’ Vision Party. The new government is surrounded by hostile neighbors, including Quebec, which hopes to use the United States in order to regain the French mainland from the Bonapartists.

Smith is a slightly more of a reactionary than Dewey, and believes that authoritarian elements are needed in the threatened democracy to keep America from falling into the hands of Vanguardists and Populists. Dewey, on the other hand, firmly believes that it is a mistake to direct America to anything else but proper democracy, and vows to keep the country together under a moderate democratic presidency. The votes have been counted, and the results are ready to be broadcast on the radio. The winner of the election is..."
