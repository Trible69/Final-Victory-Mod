AMS_request_foreign_equipment:0 "Request Foreign Equipment"
AMS_request_foreign_equipment_desc:0 "The war effort is beginning to fail, and the problem? We don’t have enough weapons. As much as it will diminish our ranking in respect, we must ask the international community for any of their spare arms. Only then will we finally be able to expel Vanguardist and Federalist influence from the country once and for all!"
AMS_continue_project_a36:0 "Continue Project A-36"
AMS_continue_project_a36_desc:0 "With the American Civil War in full swing, it’s time we finally continue developing Project A-36. This will hopefully increase our standing in the air and will help our troops hold their ground after taking enemy positions." #You can stand in the air?#
AMS_develop_light_bombers:0 "Develop Light Bombers"
AMS_develop_light_bombers_desc:0 "Light bombers are essential in ground operations as they serve three purposes they ensure our boys on the ground can advance with little to no enemy resistance, that the enemy is too dazed to fight back effectively, and draw the majority of anti-aircraft rounds away from our heavy bombers."

AMS_lindberghs_youth_legions_desc:0 "A strong America must always be at guard against foreign enemies wherever they may be, so it’s only good to train them at a young age to make sure that our enemies will stand no chance against our state or its hegemony."

AMS_emergency_factory_construction:0 "Emergency Factory Construction"
AMS_emergency_factory_construction_desc:0 "News has reached Lindbergh that there are more civilian factories than military factories per capita.

AMS_the_states_army:0 "The States' Army"
AMS_the_states_army_desc:0 "As is said in the constitution of the United States, the second amendment states that everyone has the right to bear arms and to fight against tyranny. I think it’s time we finally act on this advantage and proclaim that refusing to fight for the American State is helping the tyranny of the United States government gain control."
AMS_push_on_the_vanguardist_front:0 "Push on the Vanguardist Front"
AMS_push_on_the_vanguardist_front_desc:0 "One thing that’s worse than a Yankee is a Vanguardist. Collectivists are the true enemies of America, not Britain, not Washington, not even America’s neighbors. Starting today, the military will begin enacting plans to defeat the vanguardists to make sure America is safe no matter who wins."
AMS_a_new_america:0 "A New America"
AMS_a_new_america_desc:0 "After fighting for so long we have finally come out on top. No more shall the ghosts of past mistakes haunt us today!

AMS_mobile_death_squads:0 "Mobile Death Squads"
AMS_mobile_death_squads_desc:0 "Sure, our regime is secure, but what if we made it even more secure? Starting today, the new mobile death squads shall be introduced to the American public. With this new development, the American populace will be afraid to question our rule forever."

AMS_secure_the_midwestern_states:0 "Secure the Mid-Western States"
AMS_secure_the_midwestern_states_desc:0 "Some citizens and local governments in the states of Louisiana and Missouri still harbor some Federalist sympathies. To prevent a possible rebellion, intervention in the area seems necessary. Hopefully such action will stabilize these states and benefit our territorial integrity."
AMS_fortify_missouri:0 "Fortify Missouri"
AMS_fortify_missouri_desc:0 "The Mississippi and Missouri Rivers provide excellent defensive ground and the trees provide cover from possible air attacks and artillery fire. Capitalizing on this opportunity would be of great benefit to our defense against the Vanguardist onslaught from the Rust Belt states."
AMS_fortify_virginia:0 "Fortify Virginia"
AMS_fortify_virginia_desc:0 "Virginia provides many rivers and barrier islands, enabling an almost impenetrable and elastic defense. Federalist attacks, even at their strongest, should be relatively unable to break through such a defensive line, should it be prepared and utilized properly."
AMS_american_nationalism:0 "American Nationalism"
AMS_american_nationalism_desc:0 "It is time the American people truly appreciate their heritage and national identity. Maybe we could push them in the right direction.

AMS_push_on_the_federal_front:0 "Push on the Federal Front"
AMS_push_on_the_federal_front_desc:0 "The Federalists are weak after the loss of their main industrial and administrative centers. An offensive into the Maryland riverland, ending in the Pennsylvania mountains will surely shake their resolve and reduce the popular will to fight. That is, should such an attack succeed. To ensure the success of such an offensive, our armored divisions should be diverted to our northeastern front and push from there."
AMS_seize_prewar_arms_stockpiles:0 "Seize Prewar Arms Stockpiles"
AMS_seize_prewar_arms_stockpiles_desc:0 "Many military weapons caches have been left to our advancing armies by the Federalists. Perhaps the usage of these stockpiles will help alleviate the supply situation and prevent our divisions from losing combat effectiveness due to poor equipment."
AMS_hellcat_tank_divisions:0 "Hellcat Tank Divisions"
AMS_hellcat_tank_divisions_desc:0 "Good news from our laboratories and factories! Enough steel and other metals have been procured to form some new tank divisions. Even more exciting is these new divisions will be retrofitted with some of the latest technology our labs could provide. Needless to say, these new formations will shred our enemies into a million different pieces and leave them quivering in their boots."
AMS_naval_supremacy:0 "Naval Supremacy"
AMS_naval_supremacy_desc:0 "Some parts of the US navy, seeing the inevitability of our victory, have defected to our rightful side. We can take advantage of this by training new naval cadets and using our ships in combat, coastal bombardment, and even possible commando operations to sabotage enemy bases farther north."
AMS_convert_former_us_ships:0 "Convert Former U.S. Ships"
AMS_convert_former_us_ships_desc:0 "Some old U.S. ships sit in our dockyards, practically waiting to be modernized and employed in our new navy. As a wise man once said, the more the merrier! We shall use these ships to gain the advantage and win the naval war."
AMS_reequip_the_submarines:0 "Reequip the Submarines"
AMS_reequip_the_submarines_desc:0 "With the amount of parts we have it is possible to deliver just enough equipment for our submarine fleet to run effectively and efficiently. Equipment will be provided in short order so our submarines may prowl the seas and remove Federalist presence in the Atlantic. Hopefully our subs can guide the surface fleet and turn the tide of the naval war in Populist favor."
AMS_secure_the_east_coast:0 "Secure the East Coast"
AMS_secure_the_east_coast_desc:0 "Many leftists and centrists on our eastern coastline plot to overthrow our rightful government. These ‘revolutionaries’ are obviously led by underhumans who hope to bring about their control to our pure land and establish a state under their control. To prevent this, any dissent in the East Coast will be purged from God’s Earth as they deserve."
AMS_makeshift_weapon_making:0 "Makeshift Weapon Making"
AMS_makeshift_weapon_making_desc:0 "Our troops often lack equipment, which has lately been affecting their combat effectiveness and caused ammunition shortages. Although the quality of our weapons will decrease, the quantity of our weapons will be greater and our equipment deficit will no longer be so great."
AMS_every_citizen_a_worker:0 "Every Citizen a Worker"
AMS_every_citizen_a_worker_desc:0 "Some of our factories are relatively undermanned due to our war effort’s manpower needs. The conscription of mass amounts of citizens into our factories serves as a viable solution. Thus a ‘work tax’ will be introduced, requiring all non-combatants ages 17-50 to work a certain amount of hours a week for the war effort."
AMS_rural_production:0 "Rural Production"
AMS_rural_production_desc:0 "The untapped potential of rural weapons production can be used to further alleviate our equipment situation. Perhaps if rural production is successful, the strain on urban production will be helped or even removed entirely."
AMS_streamline_weapons_production:0 "Streamline Weapons Production"
AMS_streamline_weapons_production_desc:0 "In some places, our rifle production facilities are inefficient and lack organization, leading to wasted time and resources. To rectify this, teams of inspectors will be sent to aid in streamlining production and ensuring that no resources are wasted. Soon we will achieve the perfect military-industrial complex to overshadow that of our enemies."
AMS_combined_army:0 "Combined Army"
AMS_combined_army_desc:0 "Our army is somewhat disorganized and fractured. If it is to withstand the subhuman Vanguardists and cowardly Federalists it must be united as one. To achieve such an end, a partial overhaul of the armed forces must be put into place as soon as possible.."
AMS_internal_issues:0 "Internal Issues"
AMS_internal_issues_desc:0 "Some parts of our political machine and local governments seem to harbor sentiment for the subhumans and leftists. This can not be allowed to stand. A purge of many parts of the government is in order and any people hoping to upend our new order will be shot for counter-Populist activity."
AMS_begin_to_rebuild:0 "Begin to Rebuild"
AMS_begin_to_rebuild_desc:0 "The civil war is finally won and our pure race is preserved for decades to come. Now it is time to rebuild and consolidate our state. Once this is complete, the purification and expansion of our nation may occur."
AMS_begin_the_new_economy:0 "Begin the New Economy"
AMS_begin_the_new_economy_desc:0 "With the war won, our new economic policy can finally be executed fully. New civilian factories and company subsidies will be provided to the populus, stimulating our economy and increasing our quality of life. It is only with an improved economy such as what is planned that we can truly move into the future and become a major power."
AMS_citizens_come_first:0 "Citizens Come First"
AMS_citizens_come_first_desc:0 "With our minds off the war and having moved to recovery, it is time to prioritize our pure White citizens above all others. Taxes will be lowered on White businesses, segregation laws will be expanded, and more funding will be diverted from lesser races towards our pure people."

AMS_be_ready_for_the_next_war_desc:0 "Although much of our civilian population has recently demobilized, we should still be prepared for battle in the future. Factories should be able to convert to military production quickly and reservists should be available for future use."
AMS_rebuild_damaged_factories:0 "Rebuild Damaged Factories"
AMS_rebuild_damaged_factories_desc:0 "Many of our factories have been targeted by air raids. Also, enemy guerrillas who have sabotaged their own industry before our advancing armies. This should be rectified by salvaging what we can and hiring construction crews to recover what we can’t salvage."
AMS_a_new_industry:0 "A New Industry"
AMS_a_new_industry_desc:0 "Our industry has grown to reflect the recovering economy. Our pure people are now almost fully employed, and stability has been achieved in many sectors of employment. The great American industry will help propel the nation into a future of new growth and expansionism."
AMS_the_finished_recovery:0 "The Finished Recovery"
AMS_the_finished_recovery_desc:0 "Our recovery from the past conflict is complete. Our economy has returned from the depths of the past depression, worker conditions (for whites) have increased, and most of our populus has returned to the pre-war altitude apart from a handful of scattered guerrilla fighters in the forests who are too afraid to admit defeat. Finally we can put all this hardship behind us and look to the future and its potential for our pure citizens."
AMS_try_to_convince_the_populace:0 "Try to convince the populace"
AMS_try_to_convince_the_populace_desc:0 "Many of our people are hostile to our views as they have been brainwashed by the subhumans. We should reverse these years of underhuman subversion by overhauling the education system, airing propaganda films, and placing ideological commissars in factories."
AMS_build_relations_with_quebec:0 "Build Relations with Quebec"
AMS_build_relations_with_quebec_desc:0 "Quebec seems like a promising potential ally to us. A potential partnership between our two nations may bring us closer to the British sphere and benefit our political situation in the long run."
AMS_claim_puerto_rico:0 "Claim Puerto Rico"
AMS_claim_puerto_rico_desc:0 "Possession of Puerto Rico would help further our efforts for Caribbean domination and give us access to the local manpower pool for purposes of labor. As such, we shall claim the relatively small island as ours and make preparations for a possible invasion."
AMS_make_cuba_a_state:0 "Make Cuba a State"
AMS_make_cuba_a_state_desc:0 "Many have decided that in order to prevent further rebellious action in the strategically important land of Cuba, statehood should be granted to its relatively pure people. After all, their inferior language and culture would be more easily correctable if we were to create more ties between their people and ours."
AMS_join_the_coalition:0 "Join the Coalition"
AMS_join_the_coalition_desc:0 "Due to our recent efforts in gaining British, Quebecois, and Canadian friendship, it seems that formally joining their Coalition is finally possible. We should proceed to do this immediately to further our North American interests and cover our northern flank."
AMS_befriend_canada:0 "Befriend Canada"
AMS_befriend_canada_desc:0 "In order to potentially join the Coalition, we should make an effort to gain Canada’s allyship. Through trade deals and small military attaches, it will be possible to secure contacts in Canada and possibly throughout the Coalition as a whole."
AMS_negotiate_potential_alliance:0 "Negotiate Potential Alliance"
AMS_nagotiate_potential_alliance_desc:0 "Now that major strides have been made for our nation to join the Coalition, a conference in London would be the best way to further our Coalition interests and establish deeper roots throughout the alliance."
AMS_build_relations_with_the_british:0 "Build Relations with the British"
AMS_build_relations_with_the_british_desc:0 "The best way to create greater potential for AMS entry into the Coalition would be to establish closer ties with the British Empire, the faction leader.
