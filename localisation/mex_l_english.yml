 n100_year_debt_1_desc:0 "Our already bankrupt treasury had to resort to borrowing French money to address the cost of the past war. The great price in war equipment and fortifications has created an immense amount of debt to the French state which needs to be repaid as soon as possible. The presence of such debt will make economic recovery long-winded and difficult, possibly causing economic depression for decades to come. If this pattern of economic failure continues, our position as a regional economic power will hang in the balance."

After all, when has printing money ever gone wrong?"

 mexico.3.t:0 "Our Territories Revolt!"
 mexico.3.d:0 "Across our beloved nation, many provinces took it upon themselves to declare independence. Unsurprisingly, the first one to revolt was Texas, led by Texan Governor James V. Allred. Allred has declared independence for the 3rd Republic of Texas. Despite being called a Republic, the Texan militias are imprisoning political opposition. Many Tejanos (Texan Mexicans) across Texas are under threat from the dominant Anglo-American populace. The second to revolt are the dominant Mormon-American populace of Utah who have declared independence and proclaimed the President of their nation to be Heber J. Grant, the head of the Mormon religion. Hearing of the Texan Rebellion many Anglo-Americans in California have taken arms and declared themselves as the Californian Republic. California has always been a progressive province and opposed to the Mexican Emperor. Worse news has come and states that the Central Americans have taken the opportunity to declare their provinces independent, including Yucatan. The winner of the biggest conflict our country has seen since our independence war with Spain is still up in the air."

 mexico.4.t:0 "Change Countries P1"
 mexico.4.d:0 "California, Over the past decades and centuries, the people of California have been developing a unique cultural identity that is separate from Mexican culture. This has been a point of tension for a long time, but the spark that ignited this revolution came from the exploitative resource extraction in the region, the profits of which were not given to the Californian people. The people of California are sick and tired of the parasitic Mexican Government. The people have taken up arms and will fight to the death for liberty. Texas, For a long time, the Texan people were ruled by a small minority of Spanish Speaking Tejanos. The English speaking Texans were given almost no representation within the governmental and economic spheres. With the recent instability of the Mexican state, the Texan people took the opportunity to try and create a Texas made for the English speaking population where the majority has the most power. Deseret, In the late 19th century, the Mormon people fled to Utah to escape religious persecution. They developed a highly conservative national culture and a unique identity. The Mexican colonizers oppressed them for their religious views and disrepected the conservatism of the Mormon people. With the current instability, the Mormons found the perfect opportunity to create their own nation built upon conservative ideals and Mormon theology. They now need to fight for their lives to defend their new state."

 mexico.5.d:0 "Rio Grande, The people of Rio Grande have chosen to rise up in revolt against the Mexican government. Recent estimates have shown that 55% of the people of the region supported the idea of an independent Rio Grande. With the recent Texan secession, the Texan settlers and poor of the region chose to follow their example. Central America, It was always seen as unlikely that Central America could be a unified political force. But somehow, the peoples of Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, and Honduras have set aside their differences to fight for independence from Mexico. The only unifying factor between the various groups in Central America is their mutual hatred of Mexico. Once the Mexican threat is dealt with, these groups will need to deal with conflicts with each other. Yucatan, Yucatan has always had a larger Mayan population than the rest of Mexico and its own Mayan identity. The local Mestizo population hates the European Mexican population because of the cultural oppression and the class divide between them. Because of this, Vanguardist ideas have had a strong appeal with the Yucateco people. The rallying cry of the revolution has always been a simple one, “Land and Freedom”, “Tierra y Libertad”."
