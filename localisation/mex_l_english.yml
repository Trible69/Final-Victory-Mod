 mexico.0.t:0 "Situation of Mexico in 1936"
 mexico.0.d:0 "Ever since its independence in 1810, Mexico has always been a strong regional power. At times, even outdoing its rival, the United States. But it has never been possible for this large nation to promote its status to become one of the great powers of the world. Separatism in the nation’s Northern and Southern reaches have been plaguing the nation for decades. The Regions of Alta California and Teja are flooded with immigrants who view the monarch as an dictatorial figure with no care for non-Mexicans. This had once accumulated into a revolution by the people of the state of Tejas. The unexpected uprising had led to catastrophic debt, and ever since then, the monarchical government has strongly opposed any notions of rebellion. But while the North’s rebels are kept under our boot, the South is a whole different beast. The mountains and forests of Central America shroud the many guerilla warriors who target and disrupt our supply lines. They don't care about our common heritage and only see what little differences our people have. Furthermore, these “warriors” have huge support from the local population which has given massive difficulties crushing the rebellion. Lastly, the Mexican Economy is the poorest amongst our peers in America and across the world. Our lack of Infrastructure and now massive ballooning debt have led to reliance on French Loans, but even that is slowly drying up. To combat our dysfunctional economy, we had set up a system to divert excess wealth to our capital to build and maintain public facilities across Mexico city and hopefully branch out from there. The system, however, proved to be a poor choice by the previous monarch. It caused a financial drain from our most profitable industries and the debt and social crisis that it has caused has brought our country on the verge of bankruptcy. After open strike and threats, the previous monarch stepped down in favor of Augustin, his brother. Augustin plans to turn around past mistakes and bring life to a Mexico teetering on total collapse. But does he have enough time to fix his nation? Only his actions will tell."

 mexico.2.t:0 "The Second Texan Revolution"
 mexico.2.d:0 "The troublesome territories of Tejas are once again rebelling against us. No doubt this is done by meddling of foreign powers, but we must focus on crushing the rebellion, lest we let other territories break out in revolt."
 mexico.2.a:0 "Off with their heads!"
 mexico.3.t:0 "Our Territories Revolt!"
 mexico.3.d:0 "Across our beloved nation, many provinces took it upon themselves to declare independence. Unsurprisingly, the first one to revolt was Texas, led by Texan Governor James V. Allred. Allred has declared independence for the 3rd Republic of Texas. Despite being called a Republic, the Texan militias are imprisoning political opposition. Many Tejanos (Texan Mexicans) across Texas are under threat from the dominant Anglo-American populace. The second to revolt are the dominant Mormon-American populace of Utah who have declared independence and proclaimed the President of their nation to be Heber J. Grant, the head of the Mormon religion. Hearing of the Texan Rebellion many Anglo-Americans in California have taken arms and declared themselves as the Californian Republic. California has always been a progressive province and opposed to the Mexican Emperor. Worse news has come and states that the Central Americans have taken the opportunity to declare their provinces independent, including Yucatan. The winner of the biggest conflict our country has seen since our independence war with Spain is still up in the air."
 mexico.3.a:0 "The End is Near.."
 mexico.4.t:0 "Change Countries Part 1"
 mexico.4.d:0 "California, Over the past decades and centuries, the people of California have been developing a unique cultural identity that is separate from Mexican culture. This has been a point of tension for a long time, but the spark that ignited this revolution came from the exploitative resource extraction in the region, the profits of which were not given to the Californian people. The people of California are sick and tired of the parasitic Mexican Government. The people have taken up arms and will fight to the death for liberty. Texas, For a long time, the Texan people were ruled by a small minority of Spanish Speaking Tejanos. The English speaking Texans were given almost no representation within the governmental and economic spheres. With the recent instability of the Mexican state, the Texan people took the opportunity to try and create a Texas made for the English speaking population where the majority has the most power. Deseret, In the late 19th century, the Mormon people fled to Utah to escape religious persecution. They developed a highly conservative national culture and a unique identity. The Mexican colonizers oppressed them for their religious views and disrepected the conservatism of the Mormon people. With the current instability, the Mormons found the perfect opportunity to create their own nation built upon conservative ideals and Mormon theology. They now need to fight for their lives to defend their new state."

 mexico.5.d:0 "Rio Grande, The people of Rio Grande have chosen to rise up in revolt against the Mexican government. Recent estimates have shown that 55% of the people of the region supported the idea of an independent Rio Grande. With the recent Texan secession, the Texan settlers and poor of the region chose to follow their example. Central America, It was always seen as unlikely that Central America could be a unified political force. But somehow, the peoples of Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, and Honduras have set aside their differences to fight for independence from Mexico. The only unifying factor between the various groups in Central America is their mutual hatred of Mexico. Once the Mexican threat is dealt with, these groups will need to deal with conflicts with each other. Yucatan, Yucatan has always had a larger Mayan population than the rest of Mexico and its own Mayan identity. The local Mestizo population hates the European Mexican population because of the cultural oppression and the class divide between them. Because of this, Vanguardist ideas have had a strong appeal with the Yucateco people. The rallying cry of the revolution has always been a simple one, “Land and Freedom”, “Tierra y Libertad”."

 mexico.15.t:0 "Execution of the Emperor"
 mexico.15.d:0 "The Emperor could hardly stand. His guards had beaten him into a bloody pulp throughout the week, and his eyes were nearly swollen shut. Now he stood in a decrepit courtyard, tied to a makeshift pole. Augustin knew what was coming, but he had resigned himself to his fate. He took comfort in knowing that Maria, his sons, and his daughters were now well on their way to France, away from this horrible place. Through the blood and the pain, he gazed around the area, the grayish haze of the sky illuminating the sky. He admired the beauty of his nation one last time, and let out a disheveled sigh, knowing that he would now be forever cursed to be a tyrant in the history books.\n\nA Man in the traditional Vanguardist Uniform with a Crimson armband suddenly strutted out, flanked by five men armed with rifles.\n\n“Augustin Iturbide! The People of Mexico strip you of your decadent titles and sentence you to death!” The Commissar smiled with glee and signaled his men to line up. Augustin bowed his head and began to mutter one last prayer to the Eternal Virgin. He took a moment to observe his executioners. All were very young, and they appeared to be mildly unnerved at hearing the Fallen Emperor’s prayer.\n\n“Amen.” Augustin concluded. He gazed up and thundered “I am ready.”\n\nA sense of calm washed over him as a torrent of memories washed over him. He did not care for the orders being screeched to the guards, and instead closed his eyes, remembering better days with his wife and children. Suddenly there was a loud crack, a sharp burst of red-hot pain, and then…\n\nPeace."
