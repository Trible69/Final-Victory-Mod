 QUE_COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION:0 "After the French Revolution of 1789, the surviving Bourbons fled to Quebec, vowing to retake their homeland and take revenge on their usurpers. Quebec was set up as a British puppet state to be able to have influence over the restored Bourbon kingdom. However, with the British defeat in the Great War, British influence over Quebec Waned leading to complete independence being declared in 1916. The Bourbon family continued in their extravagant lifestyle until the rise of the Infante Jaime to the throne and the title of Jacques II in 1935 after the death of his father. Jacques II denounced the extravagance of his family and ruled over Quebec with an austere attitude. He became beloved by the nobility and the people alike. Jacques II is hoping to seize the opportunity to return to his homeland of Spain and take control of his legitimate throne as the king of France and Navarre."
