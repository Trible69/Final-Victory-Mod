 the_russian_catastrophe_desc:0 "Never since the Time of Troubles Centuries ago has the Russian Nation been so thoroughly devastated. The army is a wreck of bitter old men, and the government has been rotten to the core. The puppet Tsar helplessly dances to the Supreme Minister’s dreaded tune, and the Russian People, grief-stricken from the losses of not only a catastrophic World War, but also a horrid Civil War, lay paralyzed. Only a miracle can save the Motherland now."

 the_supreme_ministers_paranoia_desc:0 "The former Grand Admiral Alexander Kolchak sees knives in every shadowy corner of Russia.

Against all odds, Kolchak prevailed and smashed the rebellion in its infancy, and put all the mutineers to death. Unfortunately for Kolchak, Wrangel, Kornilov, and all the men that followed them have become National Martyrs, particularly in the army, and the military’s loyalty has begun to rapidly evaporate."
