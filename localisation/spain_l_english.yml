 spainish_civil_war.1.d:0 "Military units and political cells allegiant to the Bourbon Dynasty have taken control of Galicia and Castile, declaring their allegiance to King Javier in a well-coordinated uprising. Although some in our government believe that these illegitimate pretenders pose no real threat to our regime, other officials have panicked, knowing Republican and Vanguardist cells to be utilizing this opportune time to prepare rebellions of their own. \n\nAlthough we are in a state of disarray at the moment, we will surely fight to the last and ensure our survival at all costs. Unless, of course, our allegiances were to change..."

If not addressed soon, these annoying upstarts may uproot our long-standing traditions and destroy the order that we have worked for for so long… \n\n… unless we wish to join the Republicans themselves in establishing a more democratic Spain.

Their bandits and raiders have also managed to sever our vital French land connection, seizing valuable convoys in the process. Although considered too radical by the vast majority of our populus, the Vanguardists enjoy support among the working class and are likely to use their proletarian influence to stage bombings throughout the country. Left unfettered, this could lead to complete popular demoralization which must be avoided at all costs. \n\nShould we desire, we may also join the Vanguardists in their insurrection. But be warned, this could lead to unforeseen consequences…"
