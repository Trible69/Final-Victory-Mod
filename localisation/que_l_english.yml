QUE_american_designs:0 "American Designs"
QUE_american_designs_desc:0 "American research and development, although stunted by their recent civil unrest and a recovering economy, is far more advanced than ours. While we rely on archaic rifles and 1920s-era chassis, the Americans have notably started to produce SMGs and machine guns en masse. To match the Bonapartist beast, we shall get a hold of American designs and begin production of our variants."
QUE_the_anglo_problem:0 "The Anglo Problem"
QUE_the_anglo_problem_desc:0 "Many pockets of former British citizens still live in our territories of East Acadia, West Acadia, and Labrador. As such, many localities have maintained their British language and culture, posing an obtrusive language barrier.

QUE_tankettes_desc:0 "Although our industry may not be able to handle mass production like Russia and the US can, we can assemble tankettes and light tanks at a similar pace. Keeping this in mind, we shall dedicate the majority of our automobile factories to light tank production, whilst leaving heavier tanks only to our most elite formations.

The two soldiers brought him to a pole in the yard, and quickly tied an old piece of rope around him, before scampering off. An officer dressed in a Royalist Uniform, and nodded to his men. “Ready!” The beaten man looked completely resigned to his fate, and offered no protestations. “Aim!” “Fire!” with a loud crack, the last Bonaparte knew no more."
