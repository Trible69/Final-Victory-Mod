 CEN.1.t:0 "A Case for an Union"
 CEN.1.d:0 "Central America is a country united by a single heritage, language and peoples. But the problem is that people of different regions think of a different system of laws and governance. They were silent during our war for independence, but now they are calling for change across the board from all sides. If we do not deal with this issue quickly, we will bring ourselves on the verge of collapse.\n \n     To deal with this crisis the provisional government of Central America has created a council from representative from all the various regions our contry constitues of. This council will be key in creating a new law code and constitution to appease all sides, and bring unity to our nation. But while this council convenes we must keep our stability in check to allow the completion of a new Central America!"
