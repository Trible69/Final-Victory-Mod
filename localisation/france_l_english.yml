 memories_of_the_long_war_desc:0 "The Great War, though a victory for the French Empire and her People, was an empty one. Her ancestral enemies still drew breath by the time the War reached its bloody conclusion, and the French had paid an ocean of blood to finally overpower the Seventh Coalition, leaving Western Europe in ruins. Seeing as Fathers, Sons, Brothers, and Cousins never came home after such a brutal conflict, almost no one apart from the Chicken Hawks in Parliament are eager to relieve the experiences of the Long War"
 le_grande_armee:0 "Le "Grande" Armée"
 le_grande_armee_desc:0 "The French Army has been the backbone on which Imperial France has been built, and it is arguably Napoleon's finest achievement. Yet the Army that torched its way across Europe has seen better days. The ranks reek of corruption and nepotism, and the war took its toll on the army by killing off the young, bright officers, leaving the embittered old men of the Old Guard to ensure the army keeps on rotting away. If France is to survive the inevitable conflicts that will arise, she must rip out nearly every shred of rot and decay that has infected her army."
 the_imperial_parliament:0 "The Imperial Parliament"
 the_imperial_parliament_desc:0 "The Spiritual Successor to the Revolutionary National Assemby, the Imperial Parliament, greatly strengthened by the reforms of Emperor Napoleon III, has granted the French People a much greater say in their government compared to other European Nations. At least, such is the case on paper. In reality, the Parliament serves as nothing more than a staging ground where Parties on the Far-Left and Far-Right can practice their screaming matches. With Frenchmen more concerned at yelling at one another, many speculate it will be internal division and strife that causes the downfall of Napoleon's legacy, rather than yet another coalition."
 ###########FOCUS##############
 FRA_the_parliament_convenes:0 "The Parliament Convenes"
 FRA_the_parliament_convenes_desc:0 "As the state-mandated period of mourning draws to a close, the Corps Legislatif is set to resume its normal sessions soon. However, most expect the next meetings to be anything but normal, as politicians argue and bicker like they never have before."
 FRA_a_firm_declaration:0 "A Firm Declaration"
 FRA_a_firm_declaration_desc:0 "Our national path has been decided by the Emperor’s divine grace. Now all that remains is the execution of Napoleon V’s undoubtedly wonderful plan. May he announce France’s interests, intentions, and goals to the world and make good on his promises as he rules."
 FRA_les_tudiants_de_france:0 "Les Étudiants de France"
 FRA_les_tudiants_de_france_desc:0 "Perhaps the most leftist mainstream institutions throughout the entire Empire are the schools and universities, even more so the student leaders that populate them. Unfortunately, their idealistic ideas have spread to a wider audience of workers, causing them to demand less work hours, more pay, and more social services."
 FRA_lglise_et_letat_desc:0 "Our attention now turns to the church. Although still traditionally conservative, religious leaders have been observed strengthening ties with leftists and promoting more liberal leanings. It is the Emperor’s job as leader and figurehead of France as to which side of the aisle he should usher the Church towards."
 FRA_lglise_et_letat:0 "L'Église et L'Etat"
 FRA_le_pitoyable_marine:0 "Le Pitoyable Marine"
 FRA_le_pitoyable_marine_desc:0 "The Marine, once a brilliant symbol of France’s brilliant successes and conquests, finds itself overshadowed by the Grande Armee."
 FRA_le_grande_arme:0 "Le Grande Armée"
 FRA_le_grande_arme_desc:0 "Our Grande Armée, once the enthusiastic torch-bearer of French liberty and glory, has fallen into a pattern of hate."
 FRA_les_gens_fatigus:0 "Les Gens Fatigués"
 FRA_les_gens_fatigus_desc:0 "Whether we like it or not, military-age men are weary of being sent to die abroad, an attitude which is unlikely to change soon. The lower class have also begun pushing for left-wing policies that would cripple our economy and forsake our national identity."
 FRA_a_new_dawn:0 "A New Dawn"
 FRA_a_new_dawn_desc:0 "The cogs of government are beginning to turn once again. However, this does not herald the end of the Emperor’s troubles, for he must ensure a smooth and correct restructuring of power. In lieu of this, Napoleon V shall schedule meetings with leaders from all sectors of government and achieve a deal that works for all."
 FRA_shut_it_down:0 "Shut it Down!"
 FRA_shut_it_down_desc:0 "The Emperor’s worst fears have been confirmed! The squabbling Corps Legislatif has entered into a state of deadlock and lockdown."
 FRA_le_parlement_bris:0 "Le Parlement Brisé"
 FRA_le_parlement_bris_desc:0 "Perhaps the toughest cog in our political machine that needs fixing is the divided Corps Legislatif. Ending the parliamentary deadlock will take a lot of negotiation and even more squabbling, but such measures are necessary to ensure that our government will function as intended by the great Napoleon I."
 FRA_big_shoes_to_fill:0 "Big Shoes to Fill"
 FRA_big_shoes_to_fill_desc:0 "The great Napoleon IV has finally died. With his passing, an internal power vacuum has formed, from which various political movements and military cliques seek to expand their control."
 FRA_his_final_words:0 "His Final Words..."
 FRA_his_final_words_desc:0 "Napoleon IV, Emperor of the French, master of Europe, conqueror, and peacemaker alike, subjugator of Germans, Spaniards, Italians, and Africans, has lived a great life. His passionate leadership and spectacular victory have culminated in the glory and prosperity of the French Empire. Now, his loving people flourish, relishing their wealth, power, and splendor, knowing that the lion’s share of the globe lies at France’s behest."

 FRA_faction_events.1.a:0 "A toast to our new American friends!"
