The army is a wreck of bitter old men, and the government has been rotten to the core. The puppet Tsar helplessly dances to the Supreme Minister’s dreaded tune, and the Russian People, grief-stricken from the losses of not only a catastrophic World War, but also a horrid Civil War, lay paralyzed. Only a miracle can save the Motherland now."
 the_supreme_ministers_paranoia:0 "The Supreme Minister’s Paranoia"
 the_supreme_ministers_paranoia_desc:0 "The former Grand Admiral Alexander Kolchak sees knives in every shadowy corner of Russia. Purges and random executions have become daily norms in Russian Society, and both the Duma and the Army have become filled with Sycophantic Yesmen deeply loyal to Kolchak, mainly out of fear, for they know one misstep will result in them being placed on the wrong end of a Firing Squad."

 legacy_of_the_siberian_mutineers_desc:0 "From April to July 1927, Generals Pyotr Wrangel and Lavr Kornilov led a brief, but heroic uprising in Western Siberia to overthrow Kolchak and his ministers, denouncing him as a traitor and tyrant. Against all odds, Kolchak prevailed and smashed the rebellion in its infancy, and put all the mutineers to death. Unfortunately for Kolchak, Wrangel, Kornilov, and all the men that followed them have become National Martyrs, particularly in the army, and the military’s loyalty has begun to rapidly evaporate."

The military remains bloated and undersupplied, and led by only a handful of Charismatic Generals left over from Kolchak's purges. The Air Service is practically non-existent, apart from a few squadrons within the army, and the Navy has not fought against an organized enemy since our many wars with the Swedes and the Turks. Unfortunately, it now falls to us to grab our many surgical tools, and rebuild Russia into the military giant she once was."

While this will drive our War Hawks berserk, the rest of Russia smiles and toasts our new Ukrainian friends."
RUS_armor_and_speed:0 "Armor and Speed"
RUS_armor_and_speed_desc:0 "The various meatgrinders of the Civil War and Great War are simply too costly to ever repeat, and younger officers and generals have come forth with new plans of mechanizing the army.

RUS_the_imperial_army_desc:0 "The Imperial Army has a long and glorious history of great victories and great triumphs, but it is also a band of shriveled, decrepit old men at the moment. The time has come to import new recruits, and shake up the general and officer staff."
