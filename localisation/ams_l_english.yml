AMS_make_cuba_a_state_desc:0 "Many have decided that in order to prevent further rebellious action in the strategically important land of Cuba, statehood should be granted to its relatively pure people.

 AMS.1.t:0 "The End of the Civil War"
 AMS.1.d:0 "The bloody conflict has finally ended with thousands of lives lost to the brutal battle. Now is the time for healing, and to prevent this from ever happening again."
 AMS.1.a:0 "Recovery is important"
 AMS.2.t:0 "Lindbergh’s Position after the Civil War"
 AMS.2.d:0 "Charles Lindbergh’s standing in American politics is precarious at best. With the end of the Civil War, Populist factional infighting and turmoil seems inevitable as different opposing groups and candidates begin their plots to topple Lindbergh’s Presidency. \nMany doubt Lindbergh’s ability to lead as he is considered a mere puppet of rich landowners and big businesses. Already a few prominent senators and politicians have declared their support for other candidates as his support base begins to slowly crumble. These recent events beg the questions leads us to ask if we want to support Lindberg or finally replace him."
 AMS.2.a:0 "Attempt to hold power."
 AMS.2.b:0 "Lindbergh’s days of leadership are numbered."
 AMS.3.t:0 "Who shall topple Lindbergh?"
 AMS.3.d:0 "It is quite obvious that Lindbergh was always just a temporary leader, an ideologue who would give Americans the morale and confidence they needed to win the Civil War but not much else. As such, the time has come to place a viable successor at the helm to steer our great nation in the right direction. So far two preeminent contenders exist, both with their own separate beliefs, strengths, and weaknesses. \nThe first of these candidates is Strom Thurmond, a traditional status-quo segregationist who led the Army to victory in the battlefields of Pennsylvania and Illinois. His youthfulness and reconciliatory policies have gained him a base of support across the war-torn Federalist and Vanguardist states as they continue to be occupied by Populist troops. However, many extremist circles regard him as a traitor to their cause, sullying his reputation in the Deep South. \nThe other is George Van Horn Moseley, a fiercely racist and anti-semitic military strongman widely known for his tactics of fear and terror during the Civil War. His actions have gained him much Southern and extremist support, while in the defeated Federalist and Vanguardist states he is ominously referred to as “America’s Butcher.” Most experts agree that he has what it takes to defeat Linbergh, but worry that the ramifications of his leadership will leave the country in ruin. \nEach faction grows more restless and violent with each passing day. Daily life is hampered by near-constant riots, protests, and even gunfights. The time to choose a candidate and end the nation’s suffering is now. Who shall it be?"
 AMS.3.a:0 "Moseley’s ambitious nature represents the true will of our pure people."
 AMS.3.b:0 "Thurmond’s political brilliance will unite the country and make America for Americans only."
 AMS.4.t:0 "Military Rebudgeting"
 AMS.4.d:0 "With the ongoing power struggle raging across the country, Moseley’s hardliners and militarists have been pushing to increase the military budget. However, Thurmond and Lindbergh’s cliques vehemently oppose such a policy, knowing it would serve to further increase Moseley’s already dangerous power. \n\nRepresentatives of all groups gathered today in Charleston to decide on this year’s military budget. For hours on end, the politicians argued to no avail, only achieving minor agreements. During the day’s heated debate, a disappointed Walter Burgwyn Jones could be seen leaving the meeting in frustration. \n\nHearing the news of the convention, rioters and criminals soon gathered outside, looting and fighting in huge huddled masses. Although police were dispatched to the area, they were unable to fight off the large hordes of incoming dissidents. Soon enough the protesters gathered in front of the South Carolina State Capitol, where the proceedings were being held. Screams and scattered gunshots could be heard outside as the atmosphere in the Capitol grew more and more tense. \n\nWith the rioters’ cries and yells breaching the chamber’s marble walls, the representatives had no choice but to make a decision. As the votes were counted, the results became clear..."
 AMS.4.a:0 "The militarists narrowly secured the vote! The budget remains the same."
 AMS.4.b:0 "Thurmond and Lindbergh’s factions won the vote. The military budget shall be reduced."
 AMS.5.t:0 "Riots in Washington D.C."
 AMS.5.d:0 "Worrying news from the nation’s old capital! Former government workers, Black leaders, and a few deposed Federalist politicians have gathered in DC to protest the new implementation of extreme right-wing policies and Northern segregation. The now abandoned Capitol and White House have been surrounded by rioters who threaten to overwhelm the two buildings and attack their beleaguered guards. \n\nOur frantically assembled militias and military are currently on standby to address the protests and arrest the dissidents. Although they haven’t moved into the city itself yet, Moseley’s faction pushes for the military to intervene as soon as possible to end the chaos. However, Lindbergh can be seen rushing from meeting to meeting and delivering short but impassioned speeches as he tries to negotiate with the white portion of the rioters as part of his platform for “unity through race”. Although only minor inroads have been made with the dissidents, Lindbergh has managed to stop direct military action… for now. Meanwhile, Thurmond, who has police support, has declared a state of lockdown in the affected areas and commenced clashes with the protesters. \n\nIn the next few hours, it becomes increasingly clear which faction wins out and gets their way in dealing with the protest. The winner is..."
 AMS.5.a:0 "Moseley! His faction manages to send in the military. The dissidents flee in chaos with tens of casualties."
 AMS.5.b:0 "Lindbergh! He successfully negotiates a deal with the White leaders and the Black rioters are arrested."
 AMS.5.c:0 "Thurmond! He manages to beat back the protesters and force them to disperse."
 AMS.6.t:0 "Bread Riots in Chicago"
 AMS.6.d:0 "Troubling news from the windy city of Chicago! Huge swathes of bloodthirsty, vengeful Vanguardists have stormed the streets, raising red flags and waving pictures of loved ones lost to the late civil war. The crowds have even managed to erect street barricades from common household objects, stopping the authorities from entering into many neighborhoods. Moseley, Lindbergh, and Thurmond could all be seen hurrying towards the burning city today as they brought their cronies and most loyal formations to deal with the protests and further their own personal agendas. \n\nThe developing situation has also drawn some attention to us by international observers, who side with the protesters and encourage their violent actions. As a result, radios and TV’s all around the world spread anti-Populist messages, acting in “solidarity” with the Judeo-Bolshevik bandits. This, combined with a variety of other factors, has forced us to act as soon as possible to end the riots. \n\nIn a rare moment of panicked unity, members of all three prevalent political cliques have been able to formulate a single coherent plan to quell the protest. It is decided that they must..."
 AMS.6.a:0 "Blame the riot on the Jewish Bolshevik revolutionaries. Send in the militias and shoot at anyone who refuses to stay at home."
 AMS.6.b:0 "Use the police to beat them back. Communists are the spawn of hell!"
 AMS.6.c:0 "Arrest their leaders, and negotiate with the starved people. Communists or not, they are white-born Americans!"
 AMS.7.t:0 "Reinforcement of Jim Crow Laws"
 AMS.7.d:0 "Since slavery died out, the Jim Crow laws have served the White aristocrats well in suppressing African-Americans in the Deep South. However, now comes the unsavory task of attempting to impose our will on America as a whole, and it is a well-established fact that the predominantly egalitarian North despises these racial separatist policies. How should we proceed?"
 AMS.7.a:0 "Slowly implement them in the conquered lands."
 AMS.7.b:0 "Immediately implement them throughout the entire nation."
 AMS.8.t:0 "Military Recruitment"
 AMS.8.d:0 "On paper and in propaganda, the Army of the American State is an all-conquering, unstoppable war machine that is devoted to their nation and race. However, the truth is far less appealing. Various ragtag militias far more loyal to their local leaders and generals make up the bulk of our armed forces, which still lies in a state of disrepair after the bloody Civil War. Our generals have suggested that we fill the gaps with more local men up North, but our political leaders have made their case against this, stating that recruiting Northerners into the army will lead to a disloyal armed force."
 AMS.8.a:0 "Our Military is far too lenient on who it allows to join!"
 AMS.8.b:0 "Cannon-fodder for impure-Americans is a fine role."
 AMS.9.t:0 "Federalist Attempt on Lindbergh's Life!"
 AMS.9.d:0 "It would seem the forces of Washington are not quite finished yet. An attempt has been made on President Lindbergh’s life, but fortunately, Lucky Lindy has prevailed. However, the assassin confessed links to underground Federalist organizations, and we must carefully choose our response to this dastardly act."
 AMS.9.a:0 "Revoke any autonomy we had granted to the conquered lands! A military government shall be placed in its stead."
 AMS.9.b:0 "This was clear incompetence by the military that allowed such an attempt to even occur!"
 AMS.9.c:0 "Too much leniency was shown by our leadership. We must change that."
 AMS.10.t:0 "Vanguardist Attempt on Lindbergh's Life!"
 AMS.10.d:0 "How are these attempts being made…?"
 AMS.10.a:0 "Send in the military to hunt down any communist resistance!"
 AMS.10.b:0 "Judeo-Bolshevism is rampant within the north. A forced relocation will allow us to keep tabs on those who wish to conspire against us."
 AMS.10.c:0 "The Vanguardist scum have struck at Lindbergh! Though the forces of Haywood were forcefully put down by our valiant troops in the Civil War, covert groups pledging allegiance to the Crimson Flag have attempted to end the life of our great leader. We must address this threat immediately!"
 AMS.11.t:0 "Effinger’s Putsch"
 AMS.11.d:0 "In the aftermath of the late leader’s assassination, his Vice President, Virgil Effinger, was quick to assume the reins of power and fervently arrest Moseley and Thurmond’s closest and most influential followers for “Judeo-Bolshevik connections” and a variety of other baseless claims. However, Thurmond and Moseley themselves are yet to be seen, with speculative claims placing their whereabouts in Canada, Quebec, and even the Caribbean. For now though, the nation remains firmly under Effinger’s control as his loyal Black Legion purges any and all remaining dissidents. \n\nAlthough Effinger’s policies and core values are still somewhat unclear, most suspect that he belongs to an insanely extremist school of thought advocating for almost complete elimination of all other races and religions from the war-torn country by all means necessary. The daily public executions of Jewish, Catholic, Hispanic, Black, and leftist leaders do seem to confirm this theory as America falls, minute by minute, into its darkest hour. Vast columns of panicked refugees have assembled near the Canadian, Quebecois, and Mexican borders, demanding asylum from what has been deemed 'Virgil’s Personal Nightmare.'"
 AMS.11.a:0 "It is time we finally purify the nation of all its evils, once and for all!"
 AMS.12.t:0 "Lindbergh's Assassination"
 AMS.12.d:0 "The chilling St. Louis air permeated throughout the chamber as Lindbergh began to deliver the final remarks to yet another impassioned speech. Unbeknownst to him, however, a silent assassin crept steadily towards the podium, revolver in hand. As the leader of the American State completed his final sentence and raucous applause began to engulf the room, the metallic bang of the .357 Magnum echoed through the air. \n\nIt seemed like the world stood still as Lindbergh’s limp body fell to the ground, bodyguards leapt desperately towards him, and civilians stampeded from the podium towards safety. One could only watch as blood oozed out of the man’s head while the panicked crowd trampled upon children separated from their parents in the utter madness of the moment. \n\nOnce the building had been evacuated and the chaos passed, all that was left on the scene was the unmoving corpse of Charles Lindbergh."
 AMS.12.a:0 "Let us pray he doesn't come to haunt us"
 AMS.13.t:0 "The Protests of Atlanta"
 AMS.13.d:0 "Protestors gathered today in the historic city of Atlanta as many Black Americans joined together to protest the re-institution of slavery and race structure by Effinger. Effinger held back the deployment of his military, only sending the most loyal Legion members to calm the protests as he was about to set an example. When the protesters’ demands were asked, they called for an alleviation of the terror and discriminatory behaviour against whites and coloured alike. \n\nEffinger knew even before he sent his Legion that these demands would occur, for he had just been looking for the perfect setting to create an example out of his political opposition. Thus, the leaders of the protests were invited to discuss terms for peace in the future. As they approached the armor truck, the protestors looked relieved; at least that was until their bodies dropped. \n\nThen came the sound of the machine guns as they mowed down the protestors by the hundreds, creating hole after hole in the protestor’s bodies. Blood gushed out on the street by the gallons creating a small pool that would take weeks to drain away. After the event, the government specifically avoided cleaning the pool to create a long lasting example for anyone who would dare to oppose Effinger’s will. \n\nBy the end of the day, a few hundred rotting corpses were all that remained of the protesters’ hopes and dreams."
 AMS.13.a:0 "None can stand in the way of the Black Legion."
 AMS.14.t:0 "Moseley's Execution"
 AMS.14.d:0 "Today officials barged into Moseley’s home to arrest him for treason for conspiring against the government. His show trial was among the shortest in the past week; he was sentenced to death by firing squad within twenty minutes. On the day of Moseley’s execution, Lindbergh and his loyalists from all across the country came to witness the historic day. Moseley’s family had also been unwillingly brought to witness his death in exchange of absolvement on any suspicion against them. \n\nAs the execution ceremony started, Moseley was blindfolded and his back forced against the wall. When asked for his last words, Moseley responded with “I was correct to never trust you Lindbergh,” and within finishing his final word, five shots rang out."
 AMS.14.a:0 "A man by the gun will fall by the gun."
 AMS.15.t:0 "Thurmond's death"
 AMS.15.d:0 "The Washington D.C. morning was normal as ever. The streets were occupied as people went to work, to school, and a government meeting was in session. Oddly enough, Strom Thurmond was absent, but the proceedings still continued with some normalcy. \n\nAfter government hours, Fielding L Wright, Thurmond’s right hand man, went to his house unexpectedly finding an unlocked door on his arrival. As worry began to fill the aide’s mind, he ran into the house and found Thurmond’s cold body lying on the floor. There were no bullets, no blood and no evidence. The autopsy declared the death was through unnatural causes but none could find what. With no one to connect Thurmond’s death to, his case was closed. \n\nPerhaps no one will know why Thurmond died."
 AMS.15.a:0 "His death was quick as his tongue."
 AMS.16.t:0 "50 Years Undone"
 AMS.16.d:0 "The auction houses were unusually full today, especially while their reconstruction was happening. There was an excited murmur including discussions of the items on sale, the price tags, and the willingness of the items. Nothing was actually available to be seen on display, but the government-run auction houses guaranteed the product to be delivered. \n\nWhile biddings occurred around the nation, Effinger and his Legion got to work. They already knew where and who everyone was, so it was just a matter of corralling the herd and instilling obedience into the new flock. The Legion went door to door in each neighborhood, finding and dragging the colored out of their homes and branding them their future. The Legion was also given strict orders to kill any resistance on sight to expedite the processing of new slaves. \n\nScreams were always heard daily in America, but they were especially loud today. Truck after truck filled with people who were crying, screaming and bleeding were ignored to avoid the wrath of the Legion. These trucks entered facilities that were set-up nationwide with the name of “Correctional Education Camp.” A place where these obedience will be torched into the new slave’s mind through either simple acceptance of their new status, or punishment by the Camp wardens. Any attempts to escape were met with extreme force and a live punishment for all new slaves to witness to understand their situation’s futility. \n\nA new layer of darkness shrouded America as the 50-year old memory was made fresh again."
